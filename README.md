### Hi, I'm Cody
**Product Manager | Data Scientist | MBA **

My goal is to bridge the gap between those who understand data and those that make decisions based on the data; applying my understanding of math and statistics to the business world. I have found there is often a disconnect between those analyzing and interpreting the data and those making decisions based on it. I’m passionate about transforming data from a siloed resource to a connective tissue that can inform decisions across an organization.

Outside of work I enjoy being outside climbing, skiing, biking etc. I am currently 5/7 of the way through a personal goal to ski on every continent. And yeah that’s about it, Oh I’m terrified of birds they have swords for mouths it’s very scary.
