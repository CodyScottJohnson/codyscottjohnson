### Hi, I'm Cody ðŸ‘‹

My goal is to bridge the gap between those who understand data and those that make decisions based on the data; applying my understanding of math and statistics to the business world. I have found there is often a disconnect between those analyzing and interpreting the data and those making decisions based on it. Iâ€™m passionate about transforming data from a siloed resource to a connective tissue that can inform decisions across an organization.

Outside of work I enjoy being outside climbing, skiing, biking etc. I am currently 5/7 of the way through a personal goal to ski on every continent. And yeah thatâ€™s about it, Oh Iâ€™m terrified of birds they have swords for mouths itâ€™s very scary.
